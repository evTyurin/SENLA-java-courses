## TASK 3
### The task of an assembly line is to assemble complex products consisting of 3 parts. A specialised class (implementing ILineStep) must be used to set up each part, which supplies the required part via the buildProductPart() method. To assemble a product, its blank is passed to the assembleProduct() method. Inside this method, the line receives the 3 necessary components and "sets" them into the corresponding methods of the resulting product. Once the "assembly" is complete, the finished product is returned from the assembleProduct() method.
### Variant of assembly lines: Tanks (body, engine, turret)
